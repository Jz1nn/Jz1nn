## 👤 About me
- 🔍 From an early age I developed a strong interest in technology and problem solving, developing a critical view of the processes and tasks I performed, even before joining a technology course.
- 🧠 During my teens and early adulthood, I honed my reading and code comprehension skills to solve problems similar to the ones I faced, both in games and in my job at an Internet Service Provider. This path gave me a growing ability to adapt, solve challenges and work as a team.
- 🧑🏽‍💻 Currently, I am focused on acquiring knowledge in the programming area to apply my full potential in developing my own innovative solutions.
- 🫡 My best qualities involve leadership, encouragement and empathy, along with a strong sense of perfectionism and practicality, which helps me understand users' needs and deliver products with high quality and efficiency. I look forward to documenting and sharing my upcoming accomplishments with the tech community.
